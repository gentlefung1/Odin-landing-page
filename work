                                <p>The Pixel 7 Pro ($899) jumps into the flagship fray with a long feature list and a lower price than much of the top-tier competition. It goes head to head with the Samsung Galaxy S22+ ($999) and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro ($999) by offering high-end hardware, solid cameras, refined performance, and good battery life. Primary benefits of the Pixel 7 Pro include stock software from Google, exclusive app experiences, and industry-leading machine learning and artificial intelligence tools. Although the Pixel 7 Pro earns high marks for its stellar photography powers and best-in-class software, the Galaxy S22+ remains our Editors' Choice winner for flagship Android phones thanks to its leading wireless performance.</p>
                                <h1>Refined Hardware Stands Out</h1>
                                <p>The Pixel 7 Pro is Google's top phone, its chief mobile device, a gateway to an entire ecosystem of Google-connected hardware and services that work together across platforms. It's what ties everything together. </p>
                                <p>One of the main selling points of the Pixel 7 Pro will be the display, after all, today's phone buyers love a big screen. The 6.7-inch OLED panel has a resolution of 3,210 by 1,440 pixels, for a density of 512ppi. It's a bit bigger than the screen of the S22+ (6.6 inches, 2,340 by 2,080 pixels, 390pp) and that of the Pixel 7 (6.3 inches, 2,400 by 1,080 pixels, 416ppi). The 7 Pro features an adaptive refresh rate display that oscillates between 60Hz and 120Hz to balance efficiency and smooth performance, which is similar to the S22+'s 120Hz screen but a boost over the 90Hz rate of the Pixel 7. The trade-off for all these pixels and speed is battery life, which we'll get into below.</p>
